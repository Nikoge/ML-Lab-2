# 1.Your task is to evaluate the performance of Adaboost classification trees and random forests on the spam data. Specifically, provide a plot showing the error rates when the number of trees considered are 10,20,..,100. To estimate the error rates, use 2/3 of the data for training and 1/3 as hold-out test data.

## Loading Input files
```{r}
spam_data <- read.csv(file = "spambase.data", header = FALSE)
colnames(spam_data)[58] <- "Spam"
spam_data$Spam <- factor(spam_data$Spam, levels = c(0,1), labels = c("0", "1"))
```


## Splitting into Train and Test with 66% and 33% ratio.
```{r}
set.seed(12345)
n =  NROW(spam_data)
id = sample(1:n, floor(n*(2/3)))
train = spam_data[id,]
test = spam_data[-id,]
```

## Trainning the Model

### Adaboost with varying depth

final_result <- NULL
for(i in seq(from = 10, to = 100, by = 10)){

ada_model <- mboost::blackboost(Spam~., 
                                 data = train, 
                                 family = AdaExp(), 
                               control=boost_control(mstop=i))

                               accuracy = c(train_ada_score, 
                                            test_ada_score, 
                                            train_forest_score, 
                                            test_forest_score), 
                               type  = c("train", "test", "train", "test"),
                               model = c("ADA", "ADA",  "Forest", "Forest"))


final_result <- rbind(iteration_result, final_result)
}

final_result$error_rate_percentage <- 100*(1 - final_result$accuracy)
ggplot(data = final_result, aes(x = number_of_trees, 
                                y = error_rate_percentage, 
                                group = type, color = type)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() + 
  ggtitle("Error Rate vs. increase in trees") + facet_grid(rows = vars(model))

```
Analysis:

From the plots we can clearly see that ADA boosted methods uses more trees(~50) to reduce the test error, while randomforest achieves saturation in short number of trees(~10). We also see that random forest achieves less error than ADA tree for both tree and test cases.


#2 Your task is to implement the EM algorithm for mixtures of multivariate Bernoulli distributions. Please use the template in the next page to solve the assignment. Then, use your implementation to show what happens when your mixture models has too few and too many components, i.e. set K = 2,3,4 and compare results. Please provide a short explanation as well.

## Description of the EM algorithm
EM is an iterative expectation maximumation technique. The way this works is for a given mixed distribution we guess the components of the data. This is done by first guessing the number of components and then randomly initializing the parameters of the said distribution (Mean, Varience).

Sometimes the data do not follow any known probability distribution but a mixture of known distributions such as:

$$p(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} p(k).p(x|k) $$

where p(x|k) are called mixture components and p(k) are called mixing coefficients:
where p(k) is denoted by 
$$ \pi_{k} $$
With the following conditions
$$ 0\le\pi_{k}\le1 $$
and 
$$ \sum_{k} \pi_{k} = 1 $$

We are also given that the mixture model follows a Bernoulli distribution, for bernoulli we know that

$$Bern(x|\mu_{k}) = \prod_{i} \mu^{x_{i}}_{ki} . ( 1 - \mu_{ki} )^{(1-x_{i})} $$
The EM algorithm for an Bernoulli mixed model is:

Set pi and mu to some initial values
Repeat until pi and mu do not change
E-step: Compute p(z|x) for all k and n
M-step: Set pi^k to pi^k(ML) from likehood estimate, do the same to mu


M step: 
$$p(z_{nk}|x_n,\mu,\pi) = Z = \frac{\pi_k p(x_n|\mu_k)}{\sum_k p(x_n|\mu_k)}$$

E step:

$$\pi^{ML}_k = \frac{\sum_N p(z_{nk}|x_n,\mu,\pi)}{N} $$


$$ \mu^{ML}_{ki}= \frac{\sum_n x_{ni} p(z_{nk}|x_n,\mu,\pi)}{\sum_n p(z_{nk}|x_n,\mu,\pi)}  $$


The maximum likehood of E step is:

$$ \log_ep(X|\mu,\pi) = \sum^{N}_{n=1} \log_e \sum^{K}_{k=1}.\pi_{k}.p(x_n|\mu_k) $$

### Code

To compare the results for K = 2,3,4, the em_loop-function provides a graphical analysis for every iteration. The function includes comments which explain what I did at which step to create the EM algorithm. The function will be finally run with K = 2,3,4.

```

## K=4
```{r, out.width='40%', fig.align = "center" }

```

## Analysis

Comparing the final plots for each of the cases, it becomes clear that when the mixture model has more components (K = 4), the EM algorithm does not perform as accurate as for fewer components (K = 2 or K = 3). The segregation between each component gets diluted as the components get higher.
